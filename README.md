# music_player_py
A python written music player using pygame and PyQt5. Currently supports .mp3, .wav and .ogg.

<br>Planning on using other modules (e.g. music-player-core from albertz or PyQt5's inbuild QMediaPlayer) instead of pygame for better song control and more support on music file type.
<br>Also planned to include more functionality, such as song lists (although there's already a song list internally, but I might include it as a visual element such as using QListView), drag and drop, audio visualizer (might not actually do this).

### Known issue
Volume text label slide will only response in steps of two, and will jump to nearest number if silded more than one step
<br>Can't scale currently playing text field

### Windows standalone executable (.exe)
See release.
