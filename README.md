# py_music_player
A python written music player using pygame and PyQt5. Currently supports .mp3, .wav and .ogg.

<br>Planning on using other modules (e.g. music-player-core from albertz) instead of pygame for better song control and more support on music file type.
<br>Also planned to include more functionality, such as song lists (although there's already a song list internally, but I might include it as a visual element such as using QListView) .
### Windows standalone executable (.exe)
See release.
